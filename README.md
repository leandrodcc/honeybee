honeybee is an R&B song generator that fetches random items from a YouTube playlist by accessing YouTube's **API** via **AJAX**. It was built with **HTML, CSS, and Javascript**, features (some subtle and some most definitely not subtle) **CSS and JS animations** and its layout is a **combination of flexbox and CSS grid** techniques.
