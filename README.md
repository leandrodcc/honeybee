honeybee is an R&B song generator that fetches random items from a YouTube playlist by accessing YouTube's **API** via **AJAX**. It was built with **HTML, CSS, and Javascript**, features (some subtle and some most definitely not subtle) **CSS, vanilla JS and anime.js animations**, a custom cursor, and its layout is a **combination of flexbox and CSS grid** techniques.
